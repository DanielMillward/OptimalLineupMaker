```pseudocode
For as long as you can:
- sample an outcome for each player
- use pulp to find the optimal one
- save in a file with the number of occurances next to it. 

Find the lineups that show up most often.

```pseudocode
For as long as you can:
- sample an outcome for each player
- use brute CUDA search to find the top 1000(?)
- save all in a file with the number of occurances next to it. 

Find the lineups that show up most often.
```
